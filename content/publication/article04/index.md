# Abstract.
abstract = "We present an analysis of runoff and rainfall data from Rio Grande, a basin located in the northeast of Brazil. The main challenges we face here are: (i) to model runoff and rainfall jointly, taking into account their different spatial units, (ii) to use stochastic models where all the parameters have physical interpretations, and (iii) to model these processes in their original scale, without assuming any transformation to attain normality of these variables."
